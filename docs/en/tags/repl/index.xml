      <description>REPL REPL stands for: READ - EVAL - PRINT - LOOP.
It refers to all of the tools that allow you to open a terminal version of Python and run code in real time, as well as see the results in real time.
The Python REPL, which is installed by default together with the Python version, is useful, but it is sometimes too rudimentary and inconvenient to use for more complex tasks.</description>
