As previously said, linter are your best friends for ensuring that everything is in order when writing the code.

To select a linter, go to the command line (press `F1` or 'Ã¹`CTRL + SHIFT + P` or go to `View > Command Palette`) and type: `> python: Select Linter` . Select the linter that you want (we recommend `flake 8`).
