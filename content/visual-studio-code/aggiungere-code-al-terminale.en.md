A very interesting feature of Visual Studio Code is the addition of the command `code file or folder>` to the terminal, which opens a vscode window based on either file or folder on which you want to work (for example, by doing `code`. you may open the current cartella within vscode).

To do so, open the Command Palette and execute (closely) the following command: `Shell command: Add the command 'code' to the PATH`

On Windows, you may add the functionality by flagging `Add to PATH` during the vscode installation process.
