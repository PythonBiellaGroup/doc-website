## RUFF

**Ruff** is an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust:

[Ruff Project](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff "Ruff")

Besides its speed, its main feature is that it can analyze python code and provide useful information for improving code quality. And to do this, it uses a set of rules that can be enabled or disabled as desired.

Ruff can replace other well-known code quality libraries such as:

* Flake8 and dozens of plugins
* isort
* pydocstyle
* yesqa
* eradicate
* pyupgrade
* autoflake

Ruff can be installed in various ways, but the easiest is:

```
pip install ruff
```

However, it is recommended to refer to its very complete documentation:

[Ruff Doc](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/ "Ruff")

And you can also test it at the following link:

[Ruff Playground](https://play.ruff.rs/)

### Advantages of Ruff

* Extremely fast
* A lots of rules
* Ability to fix many issues manually or automatically
* Extremely configurable
* Can be integrated into major editors
* Rapidly expanding and many contributors.
